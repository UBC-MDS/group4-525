# DSCI 525 Group 4

## UBC MDS Web and Cloud Computing project

The purpose of this project is to build and deploy ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a relatively large data set (~ 5.5 GB). The data can be found on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681). We are using the output of different climate models as a feature and the actual rainfall recordings as a target.

There are four milestones for this project:

## Milestone 1: Tackling big data on a laptop
- Downloading the data using API
- Combining data CSVs into a single CSV using `DASK` and `Pandas` libraries.
- Loading the combined CSV to memory and perform a simple EDA
- Performing a simple EDA in R
